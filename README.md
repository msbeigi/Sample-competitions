# Text Mining with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
### Overview
This repository contains Python code for text mining using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) â€“ a technique for topic modeling. The primary focus is on analyzing a corpus of text, extracting meaningful topics, and classifying new documents based on the identified topics.

### Key Features
LDA Topics: The code identifies topics within a given corpus using the Gensim library.

Topic Naming: A function assigns predefined topic names to the identified topics.

Topic Distribution: Another function determines the topic distribution of a new document.
