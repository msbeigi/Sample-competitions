 'CB>        DON\'T BE SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE YOUR HELMET ON THE SEAT WHERE IT CAN\nCB>        FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM!\n\nRyan> Another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). I kid you not.\n\nThis is very bad advice.  Helmets have two major impact absorbing\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\ndelaminates from age.  Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years\nfollowing his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose\nup to 80% of it\'s effectiveness from inner liner compression.  I have\na video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.\n\nPuncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and\nother relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  Even when the\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  If you are in the habit of\n"parking your lid" on the mirrors, I suggest you look under the\ncomfort liner at the condition of the foam.  If it is significantly\ndamaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.',
 'A new alternative to Scouting for those "unacceptable to BSA" for reasons\nof religious or sexual preference:\n\n\nFrom: "BOYD R. CRITZ, III" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM>\nSubject: EnviroLeague\n\n"Birth Announcement" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe\n                       Information Service\n===================================================================\n \n                     FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n                     -------------------\n \n                                     (SM)\n                        EnviroLeague\n \nA new youth movement,"EnviroLeague," was recently born, according to its\nfounder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\nenvironment.\n \nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\nObjectives:\n \n                           MISSION\n \n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\n   which we must all live.\n \n                         OBJECTIVES\n \n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\n   objectives shall be:\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\n            focus the education and participatory\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\n            of environmental concern;\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\n            their branches a full complement of program\n            materials for their use, including suitable\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\n            desirable;\n       (3)  To serve as a "clearing house" for the exchange\n            of program ideas, materials and information\n            among said organizations;  and\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate through three "Program Divisions" serving youth in\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\nthrough formation of "EnviroLeague Teams," either by EnviroLeague itself or by\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\n \nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\nyouth membership.\n \nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\n \nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the "draft"\nportions of the Mentor\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\nplace.\n \nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\'s founder chose this\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\nForums.\n \nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\'s Earth Forum - GO\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named "EnviroLeague."\n============================================================================\n \nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:\n       EnviroLeague\n       P.O.

 '\n\n\nIt clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many\ncases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is in\nthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per\nseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the\nsignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit\nconvertor is more then sufficient.\n\nAC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases\nyou are not interested in the DC level.

He assumed that\n##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by-\n##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\n##it)?  \n##\n\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\nscience.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into\nyour mouth either). \n\n   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can\nnot make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.\n\n   Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to\nbe scientific treatises. So I am just requesting the theists to stop making\nsuch wild claims.\n\n--- Vinayak\n-------------------------------------------------------\n                                           vinayak dutt\n                                   e-mail: vdp@mayo.edu\n\n             standard disclaimers apply",

None were\nhorrible, but four were five or more games below .500.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom: djohnson@cayley.uwaterloo.ca (David Johnson)\nDate: Thu, 6 Aug 1992 15:47:30 GMT\n\n\nYou win!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom king@cogsci.UCSD.EDU Thu Nov 14 14:33:45 1991\n\nYou were right!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom stvjas@meteor.wisc.edu Fri Sep 13 01:15:52 1991\n\nHe had 211 IP, but didn\'t win the Cy Young.  Maddux surprised all.\n\n\nI don\'t think I want to wait that long.  But they won 89 games last\nyear, and they were fifth in the league in ERA.  Not a bad start.\n\n\nLooks like it.  He wasn\'t bad last year, just too consistent to be an\nace.  So far this year looks like more of the same.\n\n\nI honestly can\'t say.  Did they get rid of him?  Their BB totals were\ndown last year.\n\n\nI just don\'t think he\'s that good....\n\n\n:-)  So far, so good.  I\'m *definitely* not waiting to check this one.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom panix!spira@cmcl2.NYU.EDU Fri Sep 13 12:38:08 1991\n\nCurrent plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long relief.  He has a\nrubber arm and unusual delivery.  He might be decent in that role.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom lyle@ecn.purdue.edu Sat Sep 14 01:51:28 1991\n\nWrong on all of the above.

Okay, so I exaggerate.  But I *might* have been right.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom trn@strdev.jhuapl.edu Tue Mar 31 15:25:28 1992\n\nHow much did Cal sign for?  When did he sign?

With Raines out, Bo looks to get a lot of PT.\n\n\n:-)\n\n\nHm.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------',
 "\n\n\n\nHow about Kevin Hatcher? Scored roughly 35 goals, plays 30 minutes a game.\n\n\nThat's really sad when two second-rate goalies (Barasso and Belfour)\nare the main contenders for the Vezina. Call me crazy, but how about\nTommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't\nreally play defense. It's really unfortunate that the better goalies\nin the league (McLean, Essensa, Vernon) had unspectacular years. BTW,\nif you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last 30 days,\nwhy not give the Vezina to Moog? He has been the best goalie over the\npast month.\n\n\n\n\n\nArbour or King. Burns will probably win, since playoffs aren't taken\ninto consideration - he's OK in the regular season, but I'm not sure\nif he's beaten anyone other than Hartford in the playoffs.",

 'GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\n\n\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I\'ve set all followups to sci.med\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I\'m sure most of the\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\n\n\n\n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I\'ll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT\'s comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don\'t know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er\'s?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as "Field Marshalls".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I\'ve\nknown many M.D.\'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don\'t oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor\'s.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let\'s move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n\nYou\'ve helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from \'anal retentivitis\', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\'t get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\'s made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered \'systemic\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\'s one of those \'evil\' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\'m taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\'t\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\'s\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\'s also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of \'ifs\', and \'implies\', which doesn\'t please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the \'yeast hypothesis\' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\'t observe or culture\nthe yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there\'s no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt\'s a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \'yeast hypothesis\' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\'s not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\'m very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\'s case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\'s a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n\nAren\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae ("roots") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\'ve been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract "candidiasis".  It\'s like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n\nAlso, if one is an \'anal retentive\', like I\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n\nAs I\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\'t work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\'s failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\'t plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT\'s I saw who said that I\'d just have to "live with\nit".  I\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total "cure".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT\'s totally floored him when they said "you\'ll just have\nto live with it".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n"yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n"it\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn\'t work.  I\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\n"well, I\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don\'t work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I\'ll have to register your case at the State\nBoard."  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\'ve jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\'s doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n\nWhat dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper\nworking of the mucos memebranes?\n\n\n\nI\'d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.\n\n\n\nBrave soul you are.

I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the\npost - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might\neven cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.

 '\n\n\tThis is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the\nSDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher\'s\ndefense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how\nimportant calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls\nin the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various\ncatcher\'s rank in "defense".  \n\n\tLooking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect\nthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves\n(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I\ncan tell he doesn\'t have any particular problem in his mechanics\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\nclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can\'t see how repetitions\nat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  \n\n\tAll we\'re left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\nlearn Tom Glavine\'s pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn\'t\nbe supprised if the pitcher\'s claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\n\n\tNow, since Lopez can\'t learn how to handle the major league\npitcher\'s while he\'s in AAA and since he doesn\'t have any glaring\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\ncan\'t learn just as well while in the majors?

So, if I buy the NX2000 and "excercise" it\nwell, should that slight power problem go away?  Any advice on this will be\nmuch appreciated.  Thanks.

 "\n  The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting \nBill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;\nhe was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't\nall-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when\neveryone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy\nCampanella. \n\n\n  Which reports are those? \n\n\n  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play\nhim IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.\nRight now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez\nwill be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they\nplay up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching\ntandem.  \n\n\n  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher\ndefense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from\nyour viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is\nopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.\nCatchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. \n\n  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big\nbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that\nthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard\nplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak \ndefensively if Blauser plays.

Be aware\nthat his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as\nlong as he doesn\'t have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.\n\nUmmm...sorry, no. I can buy the "in the field" part, and I think he\'ll be\nbetter at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he\'ll\nbe a pretty good hitter, couldn\'t carry Boggs\' jockstrap. With a little\nluck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,\nVentura, and Palmer will all be better).\n\n\nSee, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500\nis plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like "could run away with\nthe division" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white\ncoats. It\'s not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If\nRussell does well, Darwin doesn\'t go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn\'t pitch\njust barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could\nbe better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they\'re too\nstupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas\ncontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he\'s a\nlefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com',

 'There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\n\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\nconductor.  \n\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\nconductors to provide reliable operation  ("orange" outlets are often used for\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \n\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\nreferred to in the code as the "identified" conductor and is supposed to be\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \n\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \n\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the "U"\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\npresent a shock hazard.  \n\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\n\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \n\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\n\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\nbetween the "hot" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \n(don\'t flame ME on this, I\'m just telling you where the field comes from, not\nit\'s health effect, as far as I\'m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\n\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\n\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\'t want to\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\'t want to\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\n(since most current is in the 220 volt "hots" except at some low settings, the\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\nit\'s primarily for lightning protection.\n\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\'t a legal grounding\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in "romex" \'with ground\' is.  Anywhere\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\naluminum band off at the ends, you don\'t have to bond it to anything, it does\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \n\n"Greenfield" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\'t have\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\ngreenfield.\n\n"Wiremold" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\noften prevents good contact, and the "feed" to the wiremold extension is often\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were "hot" with\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can "bond" the wire to the\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\n\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\'t\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn\'t depend on the ground to trip.  It is\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\nGCFI\'s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \'93\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\'t changed.  It might be\nrenumbered though.) \n\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \n\nJohn',

 'Subject: Re: Eugenics\n/\n;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. \n;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will \n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\n;No breeding, no "hybrids", etc.  The ethical question is, should\n;we?\n \nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \n1) reducing the gene pool and \n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\n \nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\ncrowd out "garbage genes." This may in the future become possible. Even if\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\ndon\'t really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \n \nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\nas no different than anyone else\'s. But if we could make\n"philosopher-kings" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\n"1984."   \n \nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\nhasn\'t stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\nturns came.\n \nNot that I don\'t think that this gene altering power couldn\'t wipe us off\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \n \nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don\'t think\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\nmay not. If we don\'t, I hope there are reservoirs of "garbage" people out\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded "garbage" genes which will\npull us through. \n \nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\nthus far, or else haven\'t had enough power for long enough. \n \nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn\'t the power, it is the\nSpirit.\n \nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.',

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\nalternative health therapies.]\n\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to \'illuminate\'\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\n  were subject to changes.  The object\'s life activity was also visible in\n  highly variable colour patterns.\n\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\n\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people\'s\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\n  isn\'t actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\n\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can \'see\'\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\n  can\'t possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\n  the actual object itself.\n\n  [...]\n\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally \'charged\' by a healer\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\n\n\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, "Reality shopping; a\nconsumer\'s guide to new age hokum.", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\nvNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for\nevaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author\'s favorite examples\nof hokum.]\n\n  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of\n  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian\n  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.\n  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious "auras" or even\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,\n  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous\n  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of\n  the unknown.\n',

Fact is SCSI-2 \ncontroler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device\n{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs\nIDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the "20%\nfaster then IDE" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it\nwas there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with\nSCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device\nwith a SCSI-2 controller chip.\nSCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.

 'Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)',

 '\n\nSpecifically, which changes are you talking about?  Are you arguing\nthat the motto is interpreted as offensive by a larger portion of the\npopulation now than 40 years ago?',
 "\nLet's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\ntickets next season:-).",

 'Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\naffected the AHL this year.\n\n\nST JOHN\'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\nThe St John\'s Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played "home" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff "home"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\'s Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John\'s once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I\'m not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION\t\t\t\tANOTHER OPTION\n\t\t\t\nNorthern Division\t\t\tSouthern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\t\t\tADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\t\t\tSPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\t\t\tPROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS\t\t\t\tCDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES\t\t\tHERSHEY\n\t\t\t\t\tBINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division\t\t\tROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS\t\t\t\tHAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\t\t\tUTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\t\t\tAtlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2\nJohn Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny\nJackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.\nMitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,\nhowever Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In\nthe 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year\nto push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the\n11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when\nthe Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of\nposition players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the\ngame.',
 '\n   The following is from a critique of a "60 Minutes" presentation on MSG\n   which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS\n   DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]\n\n\t"Chances are good that if you watched \'60 Minutes\' last November\n\t3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In\n\tthe segment entitled \'No MSG,\' for instance, show host Ed Bradley\n\tmakes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them\n\t(\'millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently\n\tsick\'); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven\n\tpersonal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the\n\tsubstance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive \n\tthose studies are.\n\n\tConsider his making reference at the beginning of the program to\n\ta study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order\n\tto back up his comment that there is \'a lot of evidence\' that MSG,\n\ta flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as\n\tin many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT\n\tmake reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on\n\thumans but on rabbits.\n\n\tOne of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist\n\tPatricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that\n\ta small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get \n\theadaches from it.  \'But,\' she explains, \'the show probably \n\toveremphasized the extent of the problem.\'\n\n\tA second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor\n\tat the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley\n\tremarks, \'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory\n\tanimals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters\' because\n\tit poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olney\'s\n\tresearch with lab animals does not \'show\' anything about human\n\tyoungsters.\n\n\tIn fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney\'s \n\texperiments ever bring about any brain damage: when he injected\n\textremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing \n\ttheir digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly,\n\tand when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance\n\tto very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither\n\tof those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG \n\twith food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by\n\tenzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little\n\treaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human\n\tblood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations\n\tfound in Dr. Olney\'s lab animals.....\n\n\tThe World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of\n\tthat fact.  And so does the European Communities\' Scientific\n\tCommittee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies,\n\thave concluded that MSG is safe.\n\n\tTheir determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never\n\tbeen proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed\n\tto it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a\n\tburning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe\n\tof clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently\n\texonerated the much-maligned substance.\n\n\tThat\'s quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of\n\tmonosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever\n\twe eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one\n\tof the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken\n\tdown into glutamate during digestion.\n\n\tIt\'s a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the\n\tmost abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes\n\tup about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in\n\tmilk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.\n\n\tThat doesn\'t mean it\'s entirely unimaginable that a small number\n\tof people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore\n\tsensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international\n\tprofessional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus\n\treached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large."\n',

 'Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\'s because the Isles don\'t shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\'s a\ndefenseman.  He\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such "enforcers"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\'s "called for".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of "hockey ethics"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI\'m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn\'t call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don\'t deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,',

 "\nThree, actually.  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse\nbefore.\n\nBasically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and\nneck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and\nyou pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse\nby holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the\nhorse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a\nplow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins\nunder his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein\npulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit\n(which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).\n\nAre you sorry you asked yet?\n",

In addition, people often request information which has\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\ntitles:\n\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\n   5.

Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\'t set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\'ll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4.

(Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you\'ve tried the above methods and they\'ve failed; it\'s not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\'t have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n',

 '\nNow, that indeed is possible.  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW\nPeP from his car.  Yes, he does have a second alternator.

Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\ntries.\n\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\n\n1st period: \n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\nin \'his office\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\n\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\nthe period.\n\n2nd period: \nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\n\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\n\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\n\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\n\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\n\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\n\n3rd period:\nThe Kings used the phrase "Initiate, not retaliate" and it was very evident here\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\n\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\n\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\n\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\n\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \n8:19) took penalties.  \n\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\n\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\n\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\nright out of the game.\n\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\npenalty killing.\n\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\n\nNotes:\n------\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\n\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\n\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\n\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \ngames.

Many sites are listed as\n    providing \'anonymous FTP\'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on\n    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP\n    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via\n    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com\n    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions\n    on how to make requests.\n\n    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames\n    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.\n\n    Don\'t even ask for images to be posted to the net.

 '\n\n\nThere\'s a lot of evidence, it just hasn\'t been adequately gathered and\npublished in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics\nwho quiver everytime the word \'anecdote\' or \'empirical\' is used.\n\nFor example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book "Sinus Survival", always gives,\nbefore any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his\nnew patients IF they\'ve been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times\nin the last two years.  He\'s kept a record of the results, and for over \n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\nprogram.\n\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\nsymptoms outlined in \'The Yeast Connection\' (I agree it is a poorly \nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I\'m also\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\n\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out that\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\nsorts, and again, you don\'t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\nsince that\'s the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there\'s\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\n\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You\'ll find\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\n\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\nto the party line are academics who haven\'t been in the trenches long enough\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\nface that there is no evidence of the \'yeast connection\', I cannot guarantee\ntheir safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as\nfar as I am concerned.\n\nJon Noring\n\n-- \n\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.',

 "Well, there *is* a difference.\n\nI don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general\n_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\n\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\ncold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\nplace, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\n\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating\ntemperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).\n\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\nsomething.\n\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\noil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \n\nIf you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,\nstick to the 10W40.\n\n",

 'Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday\n     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four\ngame series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.\n"What could be better," declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs\nare challenging?\n     "It\'s pitching, it\'s always been pitching that we\'ve lacked," announced\nRyne Sandberg.  "If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or\nBunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\'ll know we might be able to\nwin.\n     "Lord, I hope we pull it off."\n     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete\nRose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\ngap in right-center.  "Cool Papa" Bell\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \n     "Teams are starting to realize that you don\'t have to pitch to Schmidt or\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\nRose at first), and it\'s a credit to the Phillies that they\'ve been able to\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times."  So came the\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas\' grounder\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\n     Sunday\'s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\neighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\nconclude their series with the Expos on Monday.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\n     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.\nThe Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\'t among the\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\nfirst in this wacky season.\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\nThe Cards captured Monday\'s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\nRogers 3-2.  "We\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\nteam speed," remarked Lou Brock.  "I don\'t see why we can\'t win this\ndivision."\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\n    "When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\npitcher\'s park like this," spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith\nHernandez added that "their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins."  The Pirates have made only\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets\' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\npitching that just wouldn\'t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\n"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while."\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves\' park had been a homer\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday\'s\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the \'61 Yankees\' pace.\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves\' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff\'s batting average was even rising.  Of\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  "Normally," Drysdale remarked, "I\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can\'t afford\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\'t\nDavis will get decked once."\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\nthe nastness of the Astros\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\nwith center field at 420 feet.  "It\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\ntantrum and told his playmates: \'If I can\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\nhome runs\'," remarked Roy Campanella.\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\nAstros didn\'t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\n     "I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop," he explained.\n     "How can we do that," Pee Wee Reese wondered.\n     "They\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\'ve got to be ready to\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We\'ll go with\na shallow infield almost the whole time."\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.

 '\nWhy don\'t you just look it up in the Merk? Or check out the medical dictionary\ncite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread?\n\n\n\nAmong others, see Olney\'s  "Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance of\nAnimal Studies to Human Safety" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol.\nvol 6: 455-462.\n\nI\'m sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.\n\n\nWhose talking about "food science"? What is this comment supposed to\nmean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*,\n*Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)\n\n\nThen you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to\n"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome" in a few articles. Why don\'t *you* point\nus to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.\n\n\nThey\'re unable to metabolise it.\n\n\nWho said anything about \'received wisdom\'? There is no question that\norally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all\nneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median\neminence. These areas are responsible for the production of\nhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal\ndevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \n\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It\'s unethical to\n"sacrifice" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\nindustry knows this. That\'s why the animal model is used in medicine\nand psych.  If you\'re talking about straight sensitivity, it would be\nuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on\npsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and\nphysiology.\n\nI suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities\n(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its\nimplication for adults (me).  Certainly\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\nendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*\nattained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. \n\n\nOlney\'s work provides a putative causal mechanism for some\nsensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally\nadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone\nfluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant\nsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient\nrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is\nresponsible not only for control of growth during development, but\nalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of\nheadaches? I don\'t know.\n',

 "\nTough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more\ndangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the \nactivity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\n\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\n\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\n\nThird don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after \ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\nand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\notherwise not in average shape.\n\nWith care, you should be ok.\n\n\nI would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.\nSomething in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  If\nyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as\nlow as a 300-400 cc bike.\n\nPossible models: \nThe Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally\ninline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to \nweakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier \nproblems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.\n\nThe Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series\nI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of\nstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.\n\nKawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know\nthem as well.\n\nFor mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to\nbuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective \nclothing and insurance and licensing costs.",

 'NASA Headquarters distributed the following press\nrelease today (4/6). I\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\n\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\n\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President\'s new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation."',

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\n\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\n\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\n\n6.

 "\nYou are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make.\nI fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the\n*process* of science and the end result.  \n\nAs an end result of science, one wants to get results that are\nobjectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the\n*process* of science.  \n\nIf good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit\nto homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information.\nBut it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This\nis where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one\nmust have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere\ncollection of empirically validated random hypotheses.\n\nExperiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but\nthey are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most\nimportant part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.  \nWithout this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No,\nhypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data.\nNor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or\nlooking out the window.  At least not unless you've done a lot of really\ngood thinking beforehand.)  \n\nThe difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre\nscientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.  \nIt depends on the quality of their THINKING.  \n\nIt really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that\nthey are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical\nstudies.  And it bothers me even more that there are many fields, such as\ncertain parts of psychology, where there seems to be no thinking at all, \nbut mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses.  \n\nAnd I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that\nscience amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes.  Simply avoiding\nmistakes doesn't get you anywhere.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

 '\n[stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted]\n\nThe Mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the\nSHO. \n\nIts hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because\nof the suspension.\n\n\nYes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In\nmy mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90\nor so. It just isn\'t safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs\noutnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in\njunkyards.\n\nI find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the\nMustang for poor brakes in relation to power.

Other countries have\ndifferent names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway\netc.\n\n\nEurope did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn\'t passed as\nfar as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than\nthe US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred\nto the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things\nyou really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more\nprofessional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars\nrunning parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.\n\n\nYou\'re wrong. GTI\'s  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal\n\nautobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers\nfoot on the floor. How do I know? - when you\'re not making any ground\non the identical car in front of you!\n\n\nIf something happens at 130-150 you\'re dead, but the same goes for much\nover 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much\nsafer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic\nbecause most people seem to be awake. I\'ve never seen any driver reading\na book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.\n\nCraig\n\nIt just doesn\'t *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody\ndrives that fast, no big deal.

 "terminated\n\nIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any\nmacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",

 '\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\nthere exist these things called "ties".  A tie occurs when a game ends\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \nThere also exits these things called "wins".  A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say "the opponent".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.  So, let\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\'s amazing.  So,\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\nthat\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\ntiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teams\nhad the same number of points.

 "I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to \nhear your comments.\n\nMILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this\nproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.\n\nThe setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\n\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\ntorque. \n\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\n\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\nbottle is $25.\n\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\nbelieve it.

 "In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid\nrockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on\na reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid\nmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of \naluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent\nAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.\nThe structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect\nsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made\na bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what\nyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in\nall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into\nthe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The\nfoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,\nso there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major\nimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the\nprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.\n\nDani Eder\n",

Also the parent from single\n: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,\n: by your arguement, die.\n\nBy your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your\nsecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what context\nmeans. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,\nthe fundamental premise of the whole process.\n: \n: |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually\n: |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social\n: |> abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative\n: |> to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in\n: |> the most fundamental social element, the family. But wait, there\'s\n: |> more.\n: |> \n: \n: Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with\n: the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\n: These days is just ain\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\'s sex &c (but that\'s \n: another arguement...) so it\'s more of a "lifestyle" decision.  Again by\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \n: as "unnatural" as each other.\n\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\nhomosexuals don\'t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\n\n: \n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\n: |> choice that should be protected by law. Now if homosexuality is a mere\n: |> choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti-social, then it\n: |> is a perverse choice; they have even less credibility than before they\n: |> became prominent. \n: |> \n: \n: People are people are people.  Who are you to tell anyone else how to live\n: their life?  Are you god(tm)?  If so, fancy a date?\n\nHere\'s pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you\'ve said anything\nor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not\ntelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments\nagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it\'s a merely an\nalternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably\ncall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize\nof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,\nand that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you\nare to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.\n: \n: |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to\n: |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of\n: |> the homosexual "life-style". But since the charge is only intended to\n: |> intimidate, it\'s really just demogoguery and not to be taken\n: |> seriously. Fact is, Jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for\n: |> suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start.\n: |> \n: \n: Again crap.  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the\n: bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by\n: a "bastard" to eternal damnation?  Or someone who crushes his penis (either\n: accidently or not..!).  Both are in Deuteronomy.\n\nI\'m sure your comment pertains to something, but you\'ve disguised it\nso well I can\'t see what. Where did I mention ideals, out-dated or\notherwise? Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything\nat all to contribute?\n\n: \n: |> As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in\n: |> scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from\n: |> teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and\n: |> biological.

In this case, harm means primarily\n: |> social, though that could be extended easily enough.\n: |> \n: |> \n: \n: You show me *anyone* who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as\n: normal, and will take of my hat (Puma baseball cap) to you.  "One man\'s meat\n: is another man\'s poison"!\n: \n\nWhat has this got to do with anything?

Other information\n\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n\tuseful when used with Windows.\n\n\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\n\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\n\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \n\tto pay up for RSI management tools.  \n\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tRAN Enterprises\n\tOne Woodland Park Dr.\n\tHaverhill, MA  01830, US\n\tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times).

Free demo ($5 outside US).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\n\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\n\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\n\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n\tone window without window controls.

It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI\'s \'load=\' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your \'run=\' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can\'t get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don\'t know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty\'s (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \n',

The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The\nfacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and\ninformation documents for the training course, will be\nprovided by the Agency.

Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra\nequals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.\n\n\nThe only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It\nwas a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.\n\n\nThe only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k\nmiles, a rare screw up by Honda.\nBoth the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars.

 "\nActually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me,\nyour UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and\nthen takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your\nequipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to\nswitchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,\nas you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.\n\nAnother way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you\nlose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to\nreplace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and\nyou've got to resync the AC in no time flat.\n\nUnfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that\nAC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to\nbe usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.\n\nSimilar story with our telephone system.

He works\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\nto make the team next year.\n\n#3\tDAVID WILLIAMS\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t\'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\nGrade:\t\tC/C-\n\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in \'91-92,\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\n\'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\nplaymaking skills that made him the team\'s leading scorer among defensemen last\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\n\n#4\tJAYSON MORE\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t\'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nAfter being touted as the team\'s top defensive prospects in training camp\nbefore \'91-92, More had a rather disappointing \'91-92, as he was not\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team\'s most\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\n\n#5\tNEIL WILKINSON\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB-\n\nWilkinson was probably the team\'s top defensive defenseman in \'91-92.  However,\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\n\n#6\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t\'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (A)\n\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team\'s MVP.  A serious knee injury\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\nbut he still finished as the team\'s top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh\'s abilities.  At the time, he\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\nsusceptible to so-called "rookie mistakes," but was probably the defenseman who\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\n\n#19\tDOUG ZMOLEK\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB\n\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn\'t show it (15 points).\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.',

 "\nWales Conference, Adams Division, Semifinal\n\nI'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the\nseries.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal\n(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely\n(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one\nof my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the\nmatchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.\n\n\nAgreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or\ndoes everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!\n\nFinal\n\nI can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for\n6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play\nin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\n\n\n\nAgreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent\nof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is\ncredit to NY.\n\n\nAgreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent\nteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.\n\n\nI think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't\nthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.\n\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\nagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\n\n\n\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\nIMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.\n\n\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\n\n\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\n\n\n\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\n\n\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. \nI don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\nGretzky.  LA in six.\n\n\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\n\n\nWow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked\nLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.\n\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\n\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\nall-round players in the NHL.\n\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\'s office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the \'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\'ll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it\'s another story again - we\'ll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that."\n \n"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\'t make sense."\n \n That\'s what the book says.  We don\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative."\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\'s entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

 "\n  The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-\nand-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.\nThe correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long\ntransocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to\nfund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit\nat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.\nBut there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount\nof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.\n  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,\nand large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask\nme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I\ncan't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by\nexisting space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and\nwe are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries\nwill be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to\nstart them, etc.\n",

 '-*----\nI think that part of the problem is that I have proposed a\ndefinition of science that I intended to be interpreted broadly\nand that Lee Lady has interpreted fairly narrowly.  My definition\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\n\n\nUnless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as a\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\nunscientific.  \n\n\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n"mainly about."\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\n\n\nI agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n"absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\n\n\nI think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --\ndeserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\nresearchers\' minds.  \n\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\nwants to become this generation\'s Rhine.\n\n\nI think this is absurd.  \n\n\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\neases one\'s defense.)\n\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little\nabout either and so have nothing to offer.',

 'Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\nfuel to the flame!\n\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves "Defensive Catcher" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves "Offensive Catcher" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don\'t walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\'t have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\'t huge, but isn\'t\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that\'s only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\naren\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\'t on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I\'d rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\'t need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they\'ve BOTH been GM\'s)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\'t count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\'s not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\'s gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\'t sign.\nOK, I\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\'d HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\'ll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn\'t work, then perhaps Sid\'s knees\ncould be "persuaded" to act up.  There\'s always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\'s going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\'t think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\'ll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\'s shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\'s a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\'re the one who wouldn\'t write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\'t be used\nto our pitching staff\'s stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I\'ll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I\'ll finally\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\n"happy pills" left around by Chuck Tanner?

 'I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn\'t as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn\'t support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn\'t run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier\'s Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus \'Generic\', and if you choose Generic you can\'t get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don\'t know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn\'t have\nthe problem.  He didn\'t know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don\'t have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren\'t really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don\'t write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I\'d better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my\nwork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the\nknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.',

 '\nAnd has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root-\nBernstein.  See his book, "Discovering".  Ring structures for benzene\nhad been proposed before Kekule\', after him, and at the same time as him.\nThe current models do not resemble Kekule\'s.  Many of the predecessors\nof Kekule\'s structure resemble the modern model more.\n\nI don\'t think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion\nof the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational\nis a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases\nof extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.\n\nFor example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of\nenantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a\nfriend\'s crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but\nPasteur\'s discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking\nat the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he\nlacked Pasteur\'s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic\nacid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.\n\nAgain, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers\n(tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because\nhe was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks\ncontained fantasies of becoming the "Newton of mirror-image life," which\nhe never admitted publically.\n\nPerhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery\nstarted this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile\nand Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths\' discoveries in mice.\nMost of Griffiths\' critics were French, which decided the issue for the\nstudent.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths\' work in vitro, which the\nstudent eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the\nresearch program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery\n(Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944).',
 "I just ordered a Saturn SL1 after considering a few imports. Frankly, the Saturn\nway of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new\ncar since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by\nmost salespeople I met.\n\nSaturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where\nI bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales\nsupport, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what\nI wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the\ndealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on\nwhat he's seen and heard from his customers. \n\nSaturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, \nfully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or\nso, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more\nlike $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any\nwarranty work, without counting against the refund.",

 '\n   [...]\n\nI think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.\nI don\'t like nuclear powerplants but i think it\'s not fair to tell such\n"storys" about them. OK ?\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\n         It has an hightech "boiler" but the rest is still verry verry \n         conventional. And if you\'ve already visited any condensation-\n         powerstation you\'l have seen the cooling towers too.\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you\'ll find\n         a chapter about the "CARNOT-process" which describes how to\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you\'ve an\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \n         side and need to cool down the steam \'till you get water\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and "cold"\n         steam on the other side you\'ll loose much more of the energy.\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\n         energy that carnot will give them.\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\n         The vapor you\'ll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\n         \n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you\'ll have lot\'s of problems with\n         the boiler\'s steel. That\'s because at this temperature the\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\n         This is only for BWR\'s. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \n\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won\'t be 0.75 mRem\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you\'ll still have\n         1.5 mRem. And i\'m not interested in glowing in the night and\n         getting children with 2 heads.

 '\n\n\n\n\nOkay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book "Brainsex" by\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\nand is well referenced. \n\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\n\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\n\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\nsexism here just reflects the "sexism" of nature in making men and women\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\nrecommend you have a look at the book "Brainsex".\n\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\n\n\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\n\n\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\nrecently reposted something here under the heading "Islam and Women" --\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \n\n\nYour statement that "other religions are no different" is, I think, a\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\n\n\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\n\n\nThe Prophet\'s first wife, who died just before the "Hijra" (the\nProphet\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\n\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.',
 "\n\nAnd you know why this is? Because you've conveniently _defined_ a theist as\nsomeone who can do no wrong, and you've _defined_ people who do wrong as\natheists. The above statement is circular (not to mention bigoting), and,\nas such, has no value.",

 'Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.\n \nAstacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.\nIn the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then\na single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the\nthrow home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\nof a sophomore jinx year.\n \nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.',

 "Now, I am jumping into the middle of this thread so I may not know\nwhat y'all been talking about, but I have a few comments:\n\n\nThere are a number of other factors that are very important, the three\nbiggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves.\nVelocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside\nof stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, the\nstacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air\nrushing in.\nAir momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of\nthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside\nlong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.\nShock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from\nescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansion\nchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)\nto the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they\ndesign for shock waves.",

 "\nI have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is\nsupposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data\ntransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is\navailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two\nmail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since\nI've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped\nto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The\nCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,\nwhich supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to\nattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the\nCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly\nlower price with two free CDs.\n\nThe Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I\nthink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the\nthree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple\ncatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo\ncd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of\nwhich are pretty good.\n\nThe NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and\na data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around\n$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible\nbefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of\nthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's\nunless you buy it in a bundle.\n\nOf the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the\nApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's\ncompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's\nspeed and performance. \n\nBTW, the models of the drives are:\n\nApple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)\n\nCD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it\nis also something like with 3401)\n\nNEC:  CDR-74\n\n\nI'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems\nwhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am\npretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.\n\nAlso, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as\nthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,\nmy hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is\njust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the\nenormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has\nthree Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and\nlives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.\n\nSteve :-)",
 "\n\nThis is becoming a tiresome statement.  Coming from you it is \na definition, not an assertion:\n\n   Islam is good.  Belief in Islam is good.  Therefore, being a \n   believer in Islam can produce only good...because Islam is\n   good. Blah blah blah.\n\nThat's about as circular as it gets, and equally meaningless.  To\nsay that something produces only good because it is only good that \nit produces is nothing more than an unapplied definition.  And\nall you're application is saying that it's true if you really \nbelieve it's true.  That's silly.\n\nConversely, you say off-handedly that _anything_ can happen under\natheism.  Again, just an offshoot of believe-it-and-it-becomes-true-\ndon't-believe-it-and-it-doesn't.  \n\nLike other religions I'm aquainted with, Islam teaches exclusion and\ncaste, and suggests harsh penalties for _behaviors_ that have no\nlogical call for punishment (certain limits on speech and sex, for\nexample).  To me this is not good.

 '\nI do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with\n"Kartagener\'s syndrome", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome\nin which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic\ninfections. "Situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrong\nside of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\nby the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\nabsence of this, laterality can be "random." People with situs\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\ncan\'t find the patient\'s heart sounds (because they\'re on the wrong\nside). \n\nAccording to Harrison\'s, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\nin a family would be affected.

 'Archive-name: space/schedule\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:23 $\n\nSPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE\n\n    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM\n\n    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,\n    and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version\n    of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)\n    periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\n\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\n    frequently.\n\n\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\n\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\n\n    The "Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual," ASC G&C 2102,\n\n\t"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\n\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\n\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage."\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\'ll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t"relative wind") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle ("a negative q-alpha").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t"downward" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force "alleviates structural loading."\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\'re about the\n\tmost "delicate" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn\'t roll ("performance gain").\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site ("decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity").\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter ("improved S-band look angles").\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, "Why isn\'t the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the "top"\n    [Orbiter side] and the "bottom" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\'s.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V\'s also had a roll program.  Don\'t ask me why -- I\'m a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the "roll\n    maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It\'s worth asking if yours doesn\'t.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\n    are not being covered.\n\n\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\n\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\n\n\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\n\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\n\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\n\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\n\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\n\n\tStation    VHF\t   10m\t   15m\t   20m\t  40m\t 80m\n\t------\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\t-----\n\tW6FXN\t 145.46\n\tK6MF\t 145.585\t\t\t 7.165\t3.840\n\tWA3NAN\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\t3.860\n\tW5RRR\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\t3.850\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.340  14.270\n\tW6VIO\t 224.04\t\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\t3.840\n\tW1AW\t\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\t3.990\n\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\n\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

 "While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently  \nwhen I bought a new truck.\n\nI had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  \nagreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax\nand license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  \nWhen I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  \nget to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  \nstarted adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  \nmiscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  \nanother $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  \ntheir problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  \nbrought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  \nreminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  \ntreated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  \ndeal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  \nthat if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  \nthat there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  \nand that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  \npretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer.

Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\n\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \nmistake.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.",

All the discussion on the net indicates that\n\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\n\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \n\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\n\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\n\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\n\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\n\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\n\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\n\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the "A" is better than "B" \n\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\n\tI am looking forward to being able to "LOADHIGH" the DD sw.  That\n\thas been an annoyance.\n\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\n\teffort to upgrade.\n\nJust my $.02 ...\n\nRegards,\nMark Bagdy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nBuddy,\n\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\n\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\nsuch).\n\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\nhappy camper.\n\n-Bruce\n-- \n  Bruce F.

 '\nWell, I used to get mad, and either try to communicate my anger to jerks,\nor to, uhm, educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic.\nNow I just try to get them off my tail.\n\nIn heavy traffic I slow down a bit, mostly so I have more buffer zone in\nfront to balance the minimal buffer behind, but I also often find that the \njerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes, switch\ninto one of them, and pass me - which is fine, because then I can keep a\nbetter eye on the jerk from behind, while looking ahead, rather than\nfrom in front, while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors.\n\nIn traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass,\nI might pull over, as if to look for a street number or name,\n(still ignoring the jerk) just to get the jerk off my tail.  \n\nIf this all sounds, well, wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic, or perhaps \n(for any psych types) passive-aggressive, consider that I prefer to get\nmy adrenaline jollies from riding, rather than from yelling at jerks.  \n\nA ride can improve my whole day, while yelling at a jerk is likely (for\nme) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger.  In the worst case,\nyelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a\ncage behind me is better armed (with the cage) than I am on a bike. \n\nOn the other hand, you might try subtly arranging to be the last\nvehicle to legally cross one or more intersections, leaving the jerk\nwaiting for cross traffic (and thus off your tail), or crossing\nillegally (hopefully in front of the waiting police).\n\nLike almost everything here, your choices and mileage will vary.\n',
 '\n\nAs you point out, the experiments would be difficult. But we know\nenough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations.\nThere are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over\nto begin a turn.\n\n\t1. Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over.\n\n\t2. Contact patch having shifted to one side, causing bike to fall over.\n\n\t3. Contact patch being accelerated to the side, causing a\n\ttorque which twists the bike over.\n\nTake an average bike/rider, average bike wheel, and at speeds of 5,\n15, and 50 mph (say) calculate how much twist of the bars would be\nneeded to produce (say) 20 degrees of lean in (say) 2 seconds by each\neffect alone. My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant, and at\nhigh speeds 3 is dominant, and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off\nbugger all, relatively speaking.\n\nBy the way, a similar problem is this: how does a runner who wants to\nrun round a corner get leaned into the corner fast? Is there a running\ngroup where we could start "counter-footing" arguments and have them\nall falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners?',

Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,\nwhere the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure\nof better. The concept is called "context", and you should really become\nfamiliar with it someday.\n\n\nUnless this transaltes to "Clemens hasn\'t gone into Lou Gorman\'s office with\na large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he\'d been traded to\nthe Jays," I\'m at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.\n\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has "won" 68% of\nthe games he\'s started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens\' career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n\nSpeaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to\nyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on the\naccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that\na racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your\ncontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to\nany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have\nspent a few too many games in goal without a mask.\n\n\nNo one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win\nat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\n\nSeriously, Roger, I\'d really like to hear your explanation of the difference\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\nand why? Did Morris somehow "learn how to win" in the intervening ten years?\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\na run lower than 1992?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com',

This would allow us to hold discussions and share\ninformation via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two\nother groups, so the mechanics would be easy.\n\nIf you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will\nmake it happen and provide you with the details.\n\nBTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my\nresearch on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this\nservice are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program\nsearches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology\nworks by comparing your question against a set of questions that have\nbeen seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded\nand used to improve the system.\n\nThis database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new\ninformation.  To try it out, do the following\n\n\ttelnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca\n\tlogin: chat\n\n\tThen select the Epilepsy item from the menu of databases.\n\n-- \nAndrew Patrick, Ph.D.       Communications Research Centre, Ottawa, CANADA\n                       andrew@calvin.dgbt.doc.CA',

 'I\'ve just installed a 5.25" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issues\nare the same.  So, to answer your questions...\n\n\n\nYou probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put\nit at a convenient number like "1".  You *could* cut a hole in the\nback of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the\nhassle?  You probably won\'t be needing to frequently change the ID of\nyour internal drive.\n\n\nYeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned\ntoo.  But it\'s no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine\nwith the overhang.  It shouldn\'t reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM\nSIMMs, though.\n\n\nYou can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple\ndealer.  The relevant parts are:\n\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25" device mounting bracket]\n\nNote Apple\'s unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\nmount a 5.25" device.  The service techs I talked to said, "Oh sure,\nwe stock those."  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\ncut out for a standard 5.25" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\n5.25" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that\'s of no use.\n\nI\'m going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25" device.\n\nGood luck with your SyQuest.',
 '                                    \n\n\nThis is not good advice.  A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed\ngetoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement.  My head (helmeted)\nhit the pavement with a "clunk", leaving a couple of dings and chips in the\npaint at the point of impact, but no other visible damage.  I called the\nhelmet manufacturer and inquired about damage.  They said that the way a\nfiberglass shell works is to first give, then delaminate, then crack.\nThis is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a\nwider area.  After the fiberglass has done its thing, the crushable foam\nliner takes care of absorbing (hopefully) the remaining impact force.\nThey told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality (delamination\nof the glass/resin layers) can occur with NO visible signs, either inside or\noutside of the helmet.  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they\nwould inspect it (including X-raying).  I did so.  They sent back the helmet\nwith a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would\ncompromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection.\n(I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim\nprior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them.)\n\nThe bottom line, though, is that it appears that a helmets integrity\ncan be compromised with no visible signs.  The only way to know for sure\nis to send it back and have it inspected.  Note that some helmet\nmanufacturers provide inspections services and some do not.  Another point\nto consider when purchasing a lid.\n',

It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's\n (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which\n are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.\n Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help\n the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.\n\n Fred W.

Why do atheists organize in groups?  \nWhat is there to discuss?\n\nResponse:\n\nMany things are discussed here, including:\n\n* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one\'s\n  family\n* Prayer in schools\n* Discrimination against atheists\n* Sunday trading laws\n* The Satanic Child Abuse myth\n* Whether one should be an overt atheist or \'stay in the closet\'\n* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students\n* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers\n* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual\n* Why people become atheists\n\nOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians\nlooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don\'t \nwant to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure \nfrom tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Hitler was an atheist!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\n\nResponse:\n\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God\'s_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God\'s_will,_and_\n   not_let_God\'s_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God\'s will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord\'s creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from "Mein Kampf", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It\'s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can\'t conclude that he\'s an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n\'truth\' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\'t to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to "interpretation", any claim that a passage \'means\' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal\'s Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal\'s Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the "avoiding the wrong hell" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\'s version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that "If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing" is not true.  Suppose you\'re believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one\'s eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one\'s interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno "cost".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to "If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal\'s wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam\'s Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam\'s Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\'s \nRazor.  In its original form, it said "Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily."  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam\'s Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as "Take the simplest solution".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam\'s Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn\'t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it\'s good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a "conversion" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and "God does not play dice"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\'re cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that "God does not play dice [with the universe]". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\'s\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein\'s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n"I believe in Spinoza\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings."\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in "Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\n\n  "The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task..."\n\n\n  "It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it."\n\nThe latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  "I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it."\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it\'s money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists\' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists\'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon\'t think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can\'t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just "is" (or "was").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust "is" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n"A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn\'t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus\'s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several "reconstructions" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel\'s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid (\'true\' or \'false\') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a "Liar \nParadox."  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is "This \nsentence is false."  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn\'t tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: "What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?"\n\n GB: "I guess I\'m pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me."\n\n RS: "Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?"\n\n GB: "No, I don\'t know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God."\n\n RS: "Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?"\n\n GB: "Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I\'m just not\n      very high on atheists."\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in "Free Enquiry" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle \'88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as "one nation under God"\n(Bush\'s phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: "American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?"\n \n EM: "It\'s bullshit."\n \n RS: "What is bullshit?"\n \n EM: "Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit."\n \n RS: "Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue."\n\n EM: "You\'re welcome."\n\nAfter Bush\'s election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\n\n  "As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government."\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press\'s Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!

Here are some\nquotes; there are many more.\n\n  "What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\n   needs them not."\n      - James Madison, "A Memorial and Remonstrance", 1785\n\n  "I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\n\n  "History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose."\n\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\n\n  "I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\n   above it."\n\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion",\n        Nov. 20, 1728\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\n\nResponse:\n\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\n\n   Article 11\n\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\nsuch as Charles Bevans\' "Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\nUnited States of America 1776-1949", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\n\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it\'s hard to say.\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.\n',

 "\nThis is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind.\nAny machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,  \nthermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  \nbetween input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  \nthe powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  \nof the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  \noil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  \nthe turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  \nsteam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  \nsomething else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  \ntype of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  \nunobjectionable).

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game).

Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of\nhandling 1200 dpi specifications.

The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it\nis done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also\naccept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but\nWindows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is\nresponsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our\ncamera images came out very good in my opinion.

I know\none's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and\ni forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong\nyou'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.\n \nif any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your\nexperience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially\nsince apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.\n \nbtw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the\ncorrelation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it\nhas both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of\nlittle boxes). Oh, well . . .",

 "Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history\nif we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a\ndefinitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots.\nTicket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost\ngone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's\ncould sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for\nmost of the year like '89). \n\tOn another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be\nforced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an\nowner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.\n\tFernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching\nstaff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.\n\tBaltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East.\n__________________________________________________________________________\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n Second to last day of the season - Gregg (The True Wild Thing) Olson\nuncorks a wild pitch allowing the Blue Jays to tie.

 'Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,\nwith Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.\nMy opinion, FWIW, to all:\n\nMark, age doesn\'t matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\nhimself to be average at best. I don\'t care if he is 15; if he plays\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I\'ll admit). Santiago\'s\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy\'s, but I don\'t have\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\n\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at\nany level, at any age, doesn\'t satisfy MY standards of evidence.\n\n    JAVIER LOPEZ 1971         \n  1990 BUR    428  101  10   1   9    5    0   1  .179   33  .236  .245  .327\n  1991 DUR    389   84   8   1   9   14    7   2  .175   29  .216  .243  .311\n  1992 GRN    445  135  22   2  14   22    7   2  .271   71  .303  .336  .456\n  1992 ATL     16    6   2   0   0    0    0   0  .306    3  .375  .375  .500\n    MAJ        16    6   2   0   0    0    0   0  .306    3  .375  .375  .500\n    MIN      1262  320  40   4  32   41   14   5  .213  133  .254  .277  .368\n    TOT      1278  326  42   4  32   41   14   5  .214  136  .255  .278  .369\n    MAJ       650  244  81   0   0    0    0   0\n    MIN       630  160  20   2  16   20    7   2\n    TOT       630  161  21   2  16   20    7   2\n\nOn a similar note, I don\'t understand why more people are not\nsupportive of Neon Deion. Granted, I thought his behavior with\nMcCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time\nhe ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he\nhas a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more\nvaluable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),\nhad a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,\nEQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF\n(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the\npotential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15\nbest hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching\nhis "prime" season of 27.

 "Hi netters,\n\nMy friend is seriously thinking of getting the Subaru SVX. There is\na local dealer here in Seattle selling them for $22600, with\nTouring package, that's $7400 off from MSRP. He thinks it's a \nvery good deal (and I think so too). Since he knows I have access to\nthe net, he would like to get anyone's opinion about this car, especially\nin the area of reliability and maintenanability.\nPlease send e-mail to me as my friend doesn't have access to the net.\n\nMy opinion about this car is, you get a lot for $22600:\nauto everything (tranny, climate control, windows, locks, folddow rear seet),\nfull wheel drive, 2+2, fast (143 top spped), heavy (3580lb);-)\n\nThanks in advacne!",

 'I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25"\nmechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First\nthere seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can\'t\nfigure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the\nbottom so I don\'t think it is for that. Any ideas?\n\nSecond, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are\na lot of jumpers on it that we don\'t know what they are for.\n\nThird, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to\nwork and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was\ntroublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on\nthe MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back on\nagian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.\n\nPlease reply to one of the email addresses below.\n\nThanks',

 '\nDo you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?  Is\nbeing a "licensed physician" enough to guarantee that someone is not\na quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,\nother people shouldn\'t say so?  Can you give an example of a\ncommonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,\nor have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer\nneed to worry about unscrupulous "healers" taking advantage of\npeople.',

 "\n\nWe had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.\nThere was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can\nwith touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).\n\nEventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases\nwhere the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time\nof speeding.\n\nI especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that\nhad stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number\nof a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...\n\nIn conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!"
